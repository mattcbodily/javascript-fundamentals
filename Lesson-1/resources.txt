Lesson One Resources

These resources cover material that was taught during the lesson one lecture, but may also include 
topics that will be covered in later lessons. Interactive resources allow you to practice your 
code while also covering core concepts. I would highly recommend using these interactive resources 
for additional practice throughout the course.
