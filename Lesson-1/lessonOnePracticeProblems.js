/* Lesson One Practice Problems

Instructions: 
Open the lesson-one-specrunner.html file in a browser(either 
by dragging it from your code editor into your browser, or 
by finding it in your files on your computer and 
double-clicking it. 

Solve the problems one at a time, making sure to check the 
specrunner in the browser as you finish them. Items in the 
specrunner will change from red to green when you have 
answered part of a problem correctly. When all of the 
problems have been completed correctly, all items and the 
bar above them will show as green.

Be sure to follow directions carefully, naming variables 
what you are prompted to name them, including casing.
Good luck! */
