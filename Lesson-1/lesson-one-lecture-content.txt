LESSON ONE - VARIABLES, DATA TYPES, OPERATORS


// * VARIABLES * //

What is a variable in Javascript?

You can think of a variable as a box that stores data we need 
in our web application. <-- add more to this section


Creating Variables

To create, or declare, a variable, we will start by using the 
'var' keyword. This keyword is followed by the name we are giving 
our variable. The name of the variable can be pretty much anything, 
but there are a couple conventions you should follow:

    1. Variable names should NOT start with a number, but instead a 
       letter or an underscore. Variable names can include numbers, 
       but shouldn't start with them.
    2. Variable names should be in camelCase(first letter lowercase, 
       all other words start with a capital, like the camelCase word 
       above.)

It would be a good idea to also name your variable in a way that it 
makes it easy to see what kind of data it is holding. For example, 
maybe you have a variable that's holding your favorite number as its 
value. You would probably want that variable to be named something 
along the lines of favoriteNumber or favNum, so it's easily 
identifiable.

After we have named our variable we will use the equal sign(=). In 
Javascript, the '=' symbol is known as the assignment operator(more 
on operators below). We use the assignment operator to assign a value 
to our variables. Following the assignment operator, we put the value 
that we would like to assign to our variable.

-- Example --

var favNum = 11;
