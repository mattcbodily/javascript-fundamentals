Lesson One: Variables, Data Types, and Functions


What are Variables in Javascript?

/// The Concept ///

You can think of variables as boxes that store data. Variables are created 
to store information that we can use throughout our web application. This 
data can range from numbers and words, to many other data types that we discuss 
later in this section.

/// The Syntax ///

To create, or declare, a variable, we will need to use the 'var' keyword.
Following the 'var' keyword we will put the '=' symbol, which is known as 
the assignment operator in Javascript. The assignment operator allows us 
to assign a value to our variable. Finally, following the assignment
operator will be the value we are assigning to our variable.

Example:

var age = 27;


What are Data Types?

/// The Concept ///

When declaring variables, we can assign many different types of data to 
them.  In Javascript, there are seven data types, they are:

1. String
2. Number
3. Boolean
4. Object
5. Undefined
6. Null
7. Symbol

* String *

Strings are values that are surrounded by quotes("", '', or ``). The 
characters inside the string can be anything from letters to numbers 
to symbols.

Example:

var string = "I am a string";

* Number *

Numbers refer to any numbers(including decimals) that are not found 
in a string.

Example:

var number = 11;

* Boolean *

Booleans have only two values: true and false.

Example:

var boolean = true;

* Object *

Objects refer to collection of related data.  They contain key/value 
pairs that give us a description of what the data is(key) and what 
it's value is(value). They are easily identified by the {} surrounding 
them. Objects will be discussed more in depth during lesson two.

Example:

var object = {
    type: 'Object'
};

* Undefined *

Undefined is a data type in Javascript that occurs when we have 
declared(created) a variable without giving it a value.

Example:

var undefined;  <-- A variable called undefined is declared but never given a value.

* Null *

Null is a data type that represents 'nothing'. Unlike the undefined 
data type, you must assign null as the value of the variable.

Example:

var nothing = null;

* Symbol *

The symbol data type is a relatively new data type in Javascript, 
introduced in ES6. More on this data type and how to use it will 
be found in lesson seven along with other ES6 topics.
