// Hello and welcome to Javascript Fundamentals! This is a beginner level course to learn the fundamental concepts of the Javascript
// language. These lessons will be broken into two different sections: An concept explanation section, and a problem solving section.
// The concept explanation section will involve going over specific Javascript concepts and syntax, while the problem solving section
// will give you an opportunity to practice what you have learned.  These problems will be offered in a drill type format, providing
// many problems for each topic, as this will provide necessary repetition to help remember the concept and it's syntax. Let's begin!

//What is a Variable?

// different, which I will cover shortly. Here are some examples of variables:

//The Syntax:
var name = "Christopher";
var age = 26;
var hungry = true;

//Syntax Breakdown:
// Above you will see the var keyword. This keyword is how we define, or create, a variable.  Following the var keyword, we add the name 
// of the variable; In the cases of above, I have named the variables name, age, and hungry respectively. Following the variable name, 
// there is an equal sign, which is called the assignment operator in Javascript. To the right of the assignment operator is the value 
// we want to store to the variable.
