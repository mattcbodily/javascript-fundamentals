Hello and welcome to Javascript Fundamentals! This is a beginner level course to learn the fundamental concepts of the Javascript language.
These lessons will be broken into two different sections: A concept explanation section, and a problem solving section. The concept 
explanation section will involve going over specific Javascript concepts and syntax, while the problem solving section will give you an 
opportunity to practice what you have learned. These problems will be offered in a drill type format, providing many problems for each 
topic, as this will provide necessary repetition to help you remember the concepts and their respective syntax. Attached to each section
