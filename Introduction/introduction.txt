Hello and welcome to Javascript Fundamentals! This is a beginner level course to learn the fundamental concepts of the Javascript language.
These lessons will be broken into two different sections: A concept explanation section, and a problem solving section. The concept 
explanation section will involve going over specific Javascript concepts and syntax, while the problem solving section will give you an 
opportunity to practice what you have learned. These problems will be offered in a drill type format, providing many problems for each 
topic, as this will provide necessary repetition to help you remember the concepts and their respective syntax. Attached to each section
will also be a list of extra resources to help you solidify the concepts that are taught. These resources will consist of videos and 
articles related to each topic, and will be able to be found in the 'extra-resources' file found in each lesson folder.

This course is going to be divided into seven sections.  Those sections are as follows:

1. Variables, Data types, Operators, Concatenation and template strings
2. Functions, If/Else Statements, Ternaries, and Scope
3. Arrays and Objects, For Loops and Basic Array Methods, For In Loops and Destructuring
4. More Array Methods and Working with Objects
5. Callback Functions and High Order Functions
6. Constructors, Classes, and Prototype Methods
